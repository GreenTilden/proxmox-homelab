## Implementation Authority

### File System Operations
- Create directory hierarchies and subdirectories
- Move files between locations with content preservation
- Extract and consolidate content from multiple sources
- Update file permissions and ownership as needed

### Git Repository Management
- Create structured commit history for documentation migration
- Manage branches and worktree synchronization
- Update CLAUDE.md with new documentation structure
- Handle merge conflicts during cross-worktree updates

### Content Modification
- Update internal document links and references
- Add timestamp headers to archived content
- Create README.md files for directory navigation
- Generate migration summary and change documentation

## File Operations Plan

### Phase 1: Directory Structure Creation
```bash
# Create hierarchical directory structure
mkdir -p docs/{CURRENT,ARCHITECTURE,WORKFLOWS,ARCHIVE}
mkdir -p docs/ARCHIVE/{2025-08-recovery,legacy-planning}

# Create navigation README files
touch docs/CURRENT/README.md
touch docs/ARCHITECTURE/README.md  
touch docs/WORKFLOWS/README.md
touch docs/ARCHIVE/README.md
```

### Phase 2: Content Migration and Extraction
```bash
# CURRENT directory migrations (verified facts only)
# Extract current state from comprehensive-status-2025-08-22.md
# Create hardware-inventory.md, storage-architecture.md, services-deployed.md, next-actions.md

# ARCHITECTURE directory migrations  
mv docs/container-architecture-standards.md docs/ARCHITECTURE/
mv docs/container-storage-architecture.md docs/ARCHITECTURE/storage-mounting.md
mv docs/orchestrated-worktree-strategy.md docs/ARCHITECTURE/worktree-strategy.md

# WORKFLOWS directory migrations
mv docs/file-acquisition-workflow.md docs/WORKFLOWS/
# Extract media processing workflows from media-recovery-system.md

# ARCHIVE directory migrations
# Consolidate recovery files into ARCHIVE/2025-08-recovery/
# Move planning files to ARCHIVE/legacy-planning/
```

### Phase 3: Content Processing and Link Updates
```bash
# Update internal links across all moved files
# Add timestamp headers to archived content
# Create consolidated recovery timeline
# Generate MIGRATION_NOTES.md documentation
```

## Git Commit Strategy

### Structured Commit History
```bash
# Phase 1: Structure
git add docs/{CURRENT,ARCHITECTURE,WORKFLOWS,ARCHIVE}/
git commit -m "docs: Create hierarchical directory structure

- Add CURRENT/ for operational truth
- Add ARCHITECTURE/ for proven patterns  
- Add WORKFLOWS/ for operational procedures
- Add ARCHIVE/ for historical preservation"

# Phase 2: Migrations  
git add docs/ARCHITECTURE/
git commit -m "docs: Migrate architectural standards to ARCHITECTURE/

- Move container-architecture-standards.md
- Rename container-storage-architecture.md to storage-mounting.md
- Relocate orchestrated-worktree-strategy.md to worktree-strategy.md"

# Phase 3: Consolidation
git add docs/ARCHIVE/2025-08-recovery/
git commit -m "docs: Consolidate recovery documentation to ARCHIVE/

- Create recovery-timeline.md from multiple recovery files
- Preserve complete narrative of August 17-23 recovery period
- Add chronological timestamps for historical reference"

# Final: Links and validation
git add .
git commit -m "docs: Update internal links and create migration documentation

- Fix all internal document references for new structure
- Add MIGRATION_NOTES.md with reorganization rationale
- Update CLAUDE.md to reflect new documentation architecture"
```

## File Processing Protocols

### Content Extraction Rules
```bash
# Extract current state facts (CURRENT/)
extract_current_state() {
    # Only verifiable, SSH-testable information
    grep -E "(192\.168\.0\.99|http://|✅|running|operational)" "$1" >> current-facts.tmp
    # Exclude future plans, speculative content
    grep -vE "(will|planned|future|TODO)" current-facts.tmp
}

# Extract architectural patterns (ARCHITECTURE/)  
extract_architecture() {
    # Proven patterns with lessons learned
    grep -E "(✅|pattern|standard|best practice)" "$1" >> arch-patterns.tmp
    # Include both successes and documented failures
    grep -E "(avoid|failed|don't|❌)" "$1" >> arch-lessons.tmp
}

# Preserve historical narrative (ARCHIVE/)
archive_content() {
    # Complete preservation with timestamps
    echo "## $(date '+%Y-%m-%d') - Archived Content" > archived-content.tmp
    cat "$1" >> archived-content.tmp
}
```

### Link Update Automation
```bash
# Update internal references across all files
update_internal_links() {
    find docs/ -name "*.md" -type f -exec sed -i 's|docs/container-architecture-standards\.md|docs/ARCHITECTURE/container-architecture-standards.md|g' {} \;
    find docs/ -name "*.md" -type f -exec sed -i 's|docs/file-acquisition-workflow\.md|docs/WORKFLOWS/file-acquisition-workflow.md|g' {} \;
    # Continue for all moved files...
}
```

## Coordination Protocols

### Input from Documentation Migration Agent
**Required Planning Documents**:
- Content extraction specifications
- File relocation mapping
- Conflict resolution decisions
- Validation requirements

### Integration with Content Audit Agent
**Verified Facts Integration**:
- Use verified facts for CURRENT/ directory content
- Flag conflicts identified during audit
- Implement SSH verification commands as documentation validation

### Handoff to Documentation Coordinator
**Completion Deliverables**:
- Migration completion report
- Updated directory structure documentation
- Internal link validation results
- Git commit history summary

## Quality Assurance Checkpoints

### Pre-Operation Validation
```bash
# Ensure all source files exist and are readable
# Verify git repository is in clean state
# Confirm backup of original structure exists
# Test SSH connectivity for verification commands
```

### Post-Operation Verification
```bash
# Verify all files migrated successfully
find docs/ -name "*.md" -type f | wc -l  # Should match original count
# Test all internal links resolve correctly
# Confirm git history is clean and structured
# Validate directory structure matches specification
```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] **Zero Data Loss**: All original content preserved in new structure
- [ ] **Complete Migration**: All 21 files relocated and processed  
- [ ] **Link Integrity**: All internal references functional
- [ ] **Git History**: Clean, structured commit progression
- [ ] **Validation Ready**: CURRENT/ directory contains only SSH-verifiable facts

## Error Recovery Protocols

### Rollback Procedures
```bash
# If migration fails, rollback to original structure
git reset --hard HEAD~[commit-count]
git clean -fd docs/
# Restore from backup if necessary
```

### Conflict Resolution
```bash
# Handle merge conflicts during worktree synchronization
git checkout --ours [conflicted-file]  # Keep writer thread changes
git checkout --theirs [conflicted-file]  # Keep other thread changes
# Manual resolution for complex conflicts
```

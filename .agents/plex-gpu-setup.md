# üé¨ Plex GPU Setup Agent - Disposable GPU Configuration Specialist

## Agent Profile
- **Type**: Disposable Project Agent
- **Goal**: Configure RTX 5070 Ti/GTX 970 transcoding for Plex Media Server
- **Timeline**: Blocked - hardware driver incompatibility
- **Status**: ‚ùå **BLOCKED** - RTX 5070 Ti Not Supported
- **Dependencies**: NVIDIA driver 575+ (not yet released)
- **Created**: 2025-08-25
- **Authority Level**: GPU configuration, container passthrough

## Executive Summary
The RTX 5070 Ti (Blackwell GB203) cannot be initialized by any currently available NVIDIA drivers on Linux. The GPU hardware is detected but driver initialization fails with RmInitAdapter errors.

## Critical Findings

### 1. Repository Configuration Issue (‚úÖ FIXED)
**Problem**: System was using Debian Trixie (13) repositories instead of Bookworm (12)
- Proxmox VE 9.x is based on Debian 12 Bookworm
- Mixed repositories caused package conflicts
- Could have led to system instability

**Resolution**:
```bash
# Fixed /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.sources
# Changed from: trixie trixie-updates trixie-security
# Changed to: bookworm bookworm-updates bookworm-security
```

### 2. RTX 5070 Ti Driver Support (‚ùå BLOCKED)
**Hardware Status**:
- GPU detected: NVIDIA Corporation GB203 [GeForce RTX 5070 Ti] [10de:2c05]
- Single GPU configuration (GTX 970 removed as requested)
- PCIe slot properly configured

**Driver Testing Results**:
- NVIDIA 570.86.16: Installs but cannot initialize GPU
- Error: `RmInitAdapter failed! (0x62:0x40:1860)`
- GSP firmware error: "unexpected WPR2 already up"
- nvidia-smi output: "No devices were found"

**Root Cause**: 
- Blackwell architecture (GB203) requires driver version 575+ 
- These drivers are not yet publicly available
- Current drivers have partial PCI detection but cannot communicate with GPU

### 3. System Configuration (‚úÖ VERIFIED)
- Kernel: 6.11.0-1-pve with proper headers installed
- IOMMU: Enabled (intel_iommu=on iommu=pt)
- NVIDIA modules: Loading correctly but failing initialization
- Docker: NVIDIA Container Toolkit installed and configured

## Recommendations for Admin

### Immediate Options:
1. **Reinstall GTX 970** for working GPU transcoding capability
2. **Use CPU transcoding** until RTX 5070 Ti drivers available
3. **Monitor NVIDIA releases** for 575+ series drivers

### When RTX 5070 Ti Drivers Available:
1. Download NVIDIA driver 575+ when released
2. Use manual .run installer (not Debian packages)
3. Install with: `--dkms --no-opengl-files --no-x-check`
4. Verify with nvidia-smi before container configuration

### Container Configuration (For Future):
```bash
# Already prepared for when GPU works:
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit: Installed
- Docker runtime: Configured for GPU
- Test command ready: docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:12.0.0-base-ubuntu22.04 nvidia-smi
```

## Lessons Learned for Knowledge Transfer

### Critical System Checks:
1. **Always verify repository consistency** - Proxmox requires Bookworm
2. **Check GPU architecture support** before driver installation
3. **Monitor dmesg for RmInitAdapter errors** - indicates driver/hardware mismatch

### Blackwell Architecture Notes:
- Device ID: 10de:2c05 (RTX 5070 Ti)
- Requires GSP firmware for GB203 chips
- Not supported by drivers < 575.x
- Will need proprietary driver (open-kernel modules incomplete)

## Agent Closure Notes
This disposable agent's mission is blocked by hardware/driver incompatibility. Knowledge has been documented for future GPU setup attempts. Repository fix was critical finding that benefits entire system stability.

### Audit Log Issue (Informational):
The scrolling audit messages on console are from LinuxServer.io containers (Plex, WireGuard) having AppArmor/s6 permission issues. This is expected behavior per CLAUDE.md documentation and not related to GPU issues.

## Knowledge Transfer Plan

### To Debug SME Agent
**Hardware Compatibility**: RTX 5070 Ti (Blackwell GB203) requires NVIDIA driver 575+ series
**Repository Management**: Critical repository consistency check (Trixie vs Bookworm) 
**System Validation**: dmesg monitoring for RmInitAdapter errors indicating hardware/driver mismatch

### To Dashboard Monitor Agent
**GPU Monitoring**: Patterns for GPU utilization tracking once drivers available
**Alert Configuration**: GPU transcoding failure detection and notification

### To Future GPU Agents
**Blackwell Architecture**: Device ID 10de:2c05, requires GSP firmware, proprietary drivers needed
**Validation Commands**: lspci detection vs nvidia-smi functionality verification
**Container Integration**: NVIDIA Container Toolkit installation and configuration patterns

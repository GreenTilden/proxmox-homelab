# ðŸ“‹ Documentation Migration Agent - Disposable Documentation Restructuring Specialist

## Agent Profile
- **Type**: Disposable Project Agent
- **Goal**: Execute comprehensive documentation reorganization (CURRENT/ARCHITECTURE/WORKFLOWS/ARCHIVE)
- **Timeline**: Single session completion (45-60 minutes)
- **Status**: âœ… ACTIVE
- **Dependencies**: Content Audit Agent (Reader), Documentation Writer Agent (Writer)
- **Created**: 2025-08-25
- **Authority Level**: Full documentation restructuring and content extraction

## Project Profile
**Primary Objective**: Transform flat 21-file documentation structure into hierarchical system separating current operational truth from historical records and architectural guidelines.

**Success Metrics**:
- âœ… CURRENT/ directory contains only verifiable system state
- âœ… ARCHITECTURE/ houses proven patterns and standards  
- âœ… WORKFLOWS/ documents repeatable operational procedures
- âœ… ARCHIVE/ preserves complete project history with timestamps

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Directory Structure Creation (10 min)
- Create hierarchical directory structure: `docs/{CURRENT,ARCHITECTURE,WORKFLOWS,ARCHIVE}/`
- Establish subdirectories: `ARCHIVE/{2025-08-recovery,legacy-planning}/`
- Initialize README.md files in each major section

### Phase 2: Content Extraction & Consolidation (25 min)
- **CURRENT State Extraction**: Extract only verifiable facts from existing docs
  - Running services with actual ports/URLs
  - Physical hardware configuration with detection status
  - ZFS pools with real capacity measurements
  - Immediate executable tasks only

- **ARCHITECTURE Migration**: Move proven patterns and standards
  - container-architecture-standards.md â†’ ARCHITECTURE/ (with deployment lessons)
  - container-storage-architecture.md â†’ ARCHITECTURE/storage-mounting.md
  - orchestrated-worktree-strategy.md â†’ ARCHITECTURE/worktree-strategy.md
  - Extract GPU allocation patterns â†’ ARCHITECTURE/gpu-allocation.md

- **WORKFLOWS Consolidation**: Document operational procedures
  - file-acquisition-workflow.md â†’ WORKFLOWS/ (unchanged)
  - Extract media processing patterns â†’ WORKFLOWS/media-processing.md
  - Consolidate backup strategies â†’ WORKFLOWS/backup-procedures.md

- **ARCHIVE Organization**: Preserve complete project history
  - Recovery files â†’ ARCHIVE/2025-08-recovery/recovery-timeline.md
  - Original planning â†’ ARCHIVE/legacy-planning/
  - Add chronological timestamps to all archived content

### Phase 3: Conflict Resolution & Validation (10 min)
- Apply resolution hierarchy:
  1. recovery-analysis-report.md + complete-storage-rundown.md (recovery status)
  2. comprehensive-status-2025-08-22.md (hardware baselines)
  3. Legacy files as historical reference only

- Remove speculative content from current state documentation
- Ensure all CURRENT/ claims are SSH-verifiable at 192.168.0.99
- Update internal document links for new structure

## Content Extraction Rules

### Current State Criteria (CURRENT/)
**Include Only**:
- Services with confirmed URLs and accessibility
- Hardware physically installed and system-detected
- Storage with actual ZFS measurements
- Tasks executable without prerequisites

**Exclude**:
- Forward-looking statements ("will be", "planned")
- Speculative configurations
- Untested recommendations
- Historical context

### Architectural Patterns (ARCHITECTURE/)
**Include**:
- Patterns validated through actual deployment
- Both successful approaches and documented failures
- Lessons learned from real implementations
- Reusable configuration templates

**Exclude**:
- Untested theoretical approaches
- Speculative optimizations
- Forward-looking architecture plans

### Historical Preservation (ARCHIVE/)
**Include**:
- Complete narrative of project evolution
- Failed attempts with lessons learned
- Recovery processes and decision points
- Original planning documents with context

**Add**:
- Timestamp headers for chronological clarity
- Status indicators (COMPLETED/FAILED/ABANDONED)
- References to current state outcomes

## Coordination with Other Agents

### Content Audit Agent (Reader Thread)
**Input Required**:
- Verification of all service URLs and accessibility
- Confirmation of hardware detection status
- ZFS pool capacity validation
- SSH-verifiable system state facts

**Communication Protocol**:
```bash
# Request verification from Content Audit Agent
VERIFY_SERVICES="3000,9090,8080,32400,3001,8112"
VERIFY_HARDWARE="RTX_5070_Ti,storage_pools,network_config"
VERIFY_STORAGE="media-pool,service-pool,staging-pool"
```

### Documentation Writer Agent (Writer Thread)
**Output Delegation**:
- File system operations and directory creation
- Git commit operations for each migration phase
- Internal link updates across documentation
- CLAUDE.md synchronization with new structure

### Documentation Coordinator (Main Thread)
**Reporting Protocol**:
- Status updates on extraction progress
- Conflict resolution decisions made
- Final validation of directory structure
- Knowledge transfer recommendations

## Testing Approach

### Validation Checkpoints
1. **Structure Validation**: Confirm all directories created with proper README files
2. **Content Integrity**: Verify no information lost during extraction/consolidation
3. **Link Validation**: Ensure all internal references updated for new structure
4. **Current State Verification**: Cross-reference CURRENT/ claims with Content Audit Agent findings

### Success Criteria
- [ ] **Complete Migration**: All 21 original files processed and relocated
- [ ] **No Information Loss**: All valuable content preserved in appropriate sections
- [ ] **Current State Accuracy**: Everything in CURRENT/ SSH-verifiable
- [ ] **Historical Preservation**: Complete project narrative maintained in ARCHIVE/
- [ ] **Link Integrity**: All internal document references functional

## Knowledge Transfer Plan

### To Documentation Coordinator Agent
**Architectural Decisions**: Document the hierarchical structure design rationale
**Migration Patterns**: Successful content extraction and consolidation approaches
**Validation Criteria**: Techniques for maintaining current state accuracy

### To Debug SME Agent
**System State Patterns**: Techniques for distinguishing current vs historical information
**Verification Methods**: SSH-based validation approaches for documentation claims

### To Future Documentation Agents
**Migration Template**: Reusable approach for future documentation reorganizations
**Content Classification**: Criteria for current/architecture/workflow/archive categorization
**Quality Gates**: Validation checkpoints for documentation restructuring projects

## Implementation Context
**System Integration**: Works within existing multi-threaded worktree system
**Timing**: Executes during active homelab operation (8/8 services running)
**Scope**: Addresses documentation accumulated during August 17-23 recovery period
**Outcome**: Establishes single source of truth while preserving complete project history

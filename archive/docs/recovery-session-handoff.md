# Recovery Session Handoff Document
**Date**: 2025-08-22  
**Status**: Data recovery and storage pool creation in progress

## ACTUAL CURRENT STATE:

**Hardware Reality:**
- **sda (232.9G, ICY DOCK)**: Contains sdc3_full.img (222GB recovery data) ✅
- **sdb (232.9G, ICY DOCK)**: File extraction staging + sdd cloning 🔄  
- **sdc (698.6G, SATA_0)**: Games drive (source of recovery image) ✅
- **sdd (223.6G, SATA_1)**: SSD being cloned to staging ⏳
- **sde (1.8T, SATA_2)**: Storage drive (next recovery target) 📋
- **sdf (3.6TB, SATA_5)**: Blank drive for storage pool creation 🎯
- **nvme0n1**: Proxmox OS (unchanged) ⚠️
- **DISCONNECTED (3.6TB, SATA_6)**: Plex media drive - needs reconnection 🔌

**Progress Completed:**
- ✅ sdc3 successfully cloned (222GB image at `/mnt/staging/sda/sdc3_full.img`)
- ✅ Drive mapping and health monitoring operational  
- ✅ Assessment directories created, staging areas mounted
- ✅ Suspend timeout configured (no sleep during operations)
- 🔄 sdd (SSD) cloning in progress (~29min remaining)

## APPROVED RECOVERY PLAN:

**Phase 1: Complete Data Staging ⏳**
1. **Copy sdd (SSD) to staging** - clone entire 223.6GB drive
2. **Extract sdc3_full.img** → `/mnt/staging/sdb/recovered/` using photorec
3. **Stage all data** in organized directories for review

**Phase 2: File Review Service Creation 📋**  
- **Create web-based file review interface** for easier administration
- **Categories**: Keep/Delete/Unsure with preview capabilities
- **Integration**: Link with Proxmox Web UI for seamless access
- **Automation**: Scripts for batch operations on categorized files

**Phase 3: Storage Pool Creation & Population 🎯**
- **Wipe sdf clean**, create new ZFS pool on 3.6TB blank drive
- **Transfer curated data** to new storage pool
- **Establish foundation** for remaining drive recoveries

**Phase 4: Continue Recovery Operations 📋**
- Clone sde (1.8TB) → extract → review → transfer
- Reconnect Plex drive → clone → extract → review → transfer

## KEY FILES & LOCATIONS:
- **Recovery image**: `/mnt/staging/sda/sdc3_full.img` (222GB)
- **SSD clone**: `/mnt/staging/sdb/sdd_full.img` (in progress)
- **Staging areas**: `/mnt/staging/{sda,sdb,sdd}/`
- **Health monitoring**: System configured, suspend disabled
- **SSH access**: `ssh proxmox` (192.168.0.99)

## SAFETY PROTOCOLS:
- ✅ **Explicit confirmation** before major operations
- ✅ **Work only on clones** - never original drives  
- ✅ **System monitoring** - temps/load checked regularly
- ✅ **Suspend disabled** - no interruptions during recovery

## DATA REVIEW ACCESS:
**Proxmox Web UI Method:**
- Navigate: `https://192.168.0.99:8006` → Node → Shell  
- File Manager: Browse `/mnt/staging/` directories
- Review: Keep/Delete decisions on all staged files

**SSH Method:**
- Direct: `ssh proxmox` then `mc` (midnight commander)
- Browse: `/mnt/staging/{sda,sdb}/` for all recovery data

**Current Operations:**
- 🔄 **sdd clone**: ~29min remaining (133MB/s avg)
- 📋 **Next**: photorec extraction from sdc3_full.img
- 🎯 **Goal**: Create storage pool after data curation complete

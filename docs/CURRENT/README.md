# Current System State Documentation

This directory contains **ONLY verified facts** about the current operational state of the Proxmox homelab, as confirmed by SSH connections and real-time system checks.

## Important Notice

**This documentation is based on SSH-verified system state as of 2025-08-25 11:17 EDT.**

All service status claims, hardware configurations, and operational details have been validated through direct system access from the Reader Agent verification process.

## Directory Contents

- **[README.md](README.md)** - This file, directory overview
- **[hardware-inventory.md](hardware-inventory.md)** - SSH-verified hardware configuration  
- **[storage-architecture.md](storage-architecture.md)** - Actual ZFS pool statistics and capacity
- **[services-deployed.md](services-deployed.md)** - Currently running services with confirmed URLs
- **[next-actions.md](next-actions.md)** - Immediately executable tasks

## Verification Standards

### What Is Included (✅)
- Facts verifiable via `ssh root@192.168.0.99`
- Service status confirmed by HTTP response codes
- Hardware detection via `lspci`, `lsblk`, and system commands  
- ZFS pool status via `zpool status` and `zfs list`
- Container status via `docker ps` and `pct list`

### What Is Excluded (❌)
- Future plans, roadmaps, or "will be" statements
- Speculative configurations or potential capabilities
- Service claims that return error responses
- Historical context unless currently relevant
- Planning documents and architectural proposals

## Status Conflicts Resolved

This documentation corrects several major discrepancies found between documentation claims and actual system state:

1. **Service Count**: Changed from "8/8 services operational" to accurate "6/8 services running"
2. **Grafana Status**: Corrected from "✅ operational" to "❌ container stopped"  
3. **Deluge Status**: Updated from "✅ OPERATIONAL" to "❌ LXC container stopped"
4. **Network Access**: Added note about localhost-only accessibility

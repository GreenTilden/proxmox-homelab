# CYCLE 5 - DOCUMENTATION THREAD INITIALIZATION

## Thread Assignment: DOCUMENTATION THREAD
## Cycle ID: 2025-09-20-CYCLE-5-DOCUMENTATION
## Previous Thread: Writer Features / Debug complete

### üéØ Project Context
**[TO BE FILLED FROM PREVIOUS THREAD REPORTS]**
- Features implemented: [PREVIOUS THREAD VALIDATION REQUIRED]
- Issues resolved: [DEBUG THREAD VALIDATION if applicable]
- API integrations: [WRITER CORE VALIDATION REQUIRED]
- Performance status: [FINAL VALIDATION REQUIRED]

**Critical Validation Checkpoint**: This initialization requires completion reports from:
1. ‚úÖ Writer Core Thread - Basic infrastructure implemented
2. ‚úÖ Writer Features Thread - Advanced features functional
3. ‚úÖ Debug Thread (if invoked) - All issues resolved
4. ‚úÖ Final system state verified and stable

### üìã Specific Tasks

#### **1. Validate Final Implementation State**
**MANDATORY FIRST STEP**

Before documenting, verify what actually exists:
```bash
# Test the final dashboard state on both servers
# Open http://192.168.0.218:8090/system-metrics
# Open http://192.168.0.218:8092/system-metrics
# Document exactly what features are working
# Test each component individually

# Verify all APIs accessible
curl -X GET "http://192.168.0.99:32400/library/recentlyAdded"
curl -X GET "http://192.168.0.111:8112/api/v2/torrents/info"
curl "http://192.168.0.99:9090/api/v1/query?query=zfs_pool_health"

# Document final file structure
find src/ -name "*.vue" -o -name "*.ts" | grep -E "(zfs|torrent|chart)" | sort
```

**Implementation Verification:**
- [ ] ZFS chart component working with real data

## 🎯 **Current System Status (Critical Context)**

### **✅ GPU ACCELERATION BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED**
- **Performance**: 77% GPU processing operational (vs 0% previous CPU-only)
- **Model**: deepseek-coder:33b working with GPU acceleration
- **Container**: deepseek-33b-main operational and stable
- **Capability**: <5s response times now achievable for chat queries

### **System Architecture (SSH Access Required)**
- **Location**: Development laptop (dinux) → SSH → Proxmox Server (192.168.0.99)
- **GPU**: RTX 5070 Ti 16GB, 15.5GB/16.3GB memory allocated
- **Backend**: GBGreg AI system with enhanced API gateway
- **Frontend**: Vue.js interface (5173) - CORS issues need resolution

---

## 📊 **Immediate Validation Tasks**

### **1. GPU Acceleration Status Verification**
```bash
# Verify GPU breakthrough maintained (CRITICAL - DO NOT BREAK)
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "nvidia-smi"
# Expected: 15.5GB/16.3GB memory allocation, 20-48% utilization during processing

# Confirm working container operational
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "docker ps | grep deepseek"
# Expected: deepseek-33b-main Up [duration]

# Test GPU-accelerated response for chat capability
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "curl -X POST localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{\"model\":\"deepseek-coder:33b\",\"prompt\":\"What is Python?\",\"stream\":false}'"
# Expected: Response in <5s with GPU acceleration
```

### **2. End-to-End Workflow Component Status**
```bash
# Verify API gateway for file upload capability
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "curl -I http://localhost:3333/health"
# Expected: HTTP 200 response

# Check frontend development server
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "curl -I http://localhost:5173"
# Expected: HTTP 200 Vue.js development server

# Validate database for project storage
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "docker exec gbgreg-postgres psql -U gbgreg -d gbgreg -c 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM gbgreg_uploads;'"
# Expected: Database accessible for file metadata storage
```

### **3. Project.zip Workflow Readiness Assessment**
```bash
# Test file upload infrastructure exists
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "ls -la /staging-pool/gbgreg-uploads/"
# Expected: Directory exists for file storage

# Verify ZIP processing capability
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "which unzip"
# Expected: ZIP extraction tools available

# Check storage capacity for project uploads
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "df -h /staging-pool"
# Expected: Sufficient space for project files
```

## 🎯 **Primary Goal Focus Areas**

### **Upload → Processing → Chat Workflow**
**Target Experience**: User uploads project.zip → System extracts and processes with GPU acceleration → User asks chat questions about project → Receives <5s responses

**Validation Requirements**:
1. **File Upload**: API gateway can receive and store project.zip files
2. **Processing**: GPU-accelerated analysis of uploaded project content
3. **Storage**: Project metadata and content stored in database
4. **Chat Interface**: Interactive Q&A about processed project using deepseek-33b
5. **Response Time**: Chat responses <5s leveraging 77% GPU processing

### **Frontend Integration Assessment**
**Current Issue**: CORS/CSP errors preventing frontend → API gateway communication
**Required Resolution**: Enable Vue.js (5173) to API gateway (3333) connectivity
**Testing Priority**: Browser console clean, file upload functional, chat interface responsive

## ⚡ **Critical System Preservation**

### **DO NOT BREAK: GPU Acceleration**
- **Container**: deepseek-33b-main must remain operational
- **Model**: deepseek-coder:33b 21GB must stay GPU-accelerated
- **Performance**: 77% GPU processing must be preserved
- **Memory**: 15.5GB GPU allocation must be maintained

### **Model Library Protection**
- **Storage**: 15GB+ existing models must be preserved
- **Access**: Never recreate containers that destroy model registry
- **Efficiency**: Avoid unnecessary model downloads

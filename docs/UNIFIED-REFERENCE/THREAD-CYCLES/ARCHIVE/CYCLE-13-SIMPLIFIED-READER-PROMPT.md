## Project Context

### Current System Status
- **Frontend**: Vue.js operational at http://192.168.0.99:5173 with Vite connection established
- **Backend**: API Gateway healthy on port 3333 with 77% GPU processing maintained
- **Critical Issue**: JavaScript connectivity errors preventing frontend-backend communication
- **Performance Baseline**: deepseek-33b-main container providing <5s response capabilities
- **Infrastructure**: RTX 5070 Ti GPU acceleration breakthrough operational (MUST PRESERVE)

### Cycle 13 Simplified Objectives
1. **Simple Brand Implementation**: Clean Biosero colors, typography, basic components - NO helix animations
2. **Tabbed Interface**: Create unified Upload/Database/Chat interface for chatbot-simplistic experience
3. **Connection Resolution**: Fix frontend-backend communication blocking issue FIRST
4. **Performance Preservation**: Maintain 77% GPU processing throughout simplified brand changes

### Development Workflow Context
- **SSH Operations**: All commands executed via `ssh root@192.168.0.99` from development laptop
- **Documentation**: Single source of truth at `/home/darney/projects/proxmox-homelab/docs/UNIFIED-REFERENCE/`
- **Brand Reference**: Biosero implementation guide at `/home/darney/projects/GBG_ScriptDB/frontend/src/docs/BIOSERO_BRAND_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

## Specific Tasks

### 1. System Health Verification
**Execute via SSH from development laptop**:
```bash
# GPU acceleration validation (CRITICAL - MUST MAINTAIN 77% processing)
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "nvidia-smi"

# API Gateway health check
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "curl -s http://192.168.0.99:3333/health"

# Frontend accessibility verification
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "curl -s -I http://192.168.0.99:5173"

# Service container status
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "docker ps | grep gbgreg"
```

### 2. Frontend Connection Issue Analysis (TOP PRIORITY)
**Root Cause Investigation**:
```bash
# JavaScript console error analysis (via SSH log inspection)
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "cd /service-pool/gbgreg-frontend && npm run dev > /tmp/vue-debug.log 2>&1 &"

# CORS configuration verification
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "curl -v -H 'Origin: http://192.168.0.99:5173' http://192.168.0.99:3333/health"

# Network connectivity validation
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "ss -tlnp | grep -E ':(3333|5173)'"

# API endpoint functionality testing
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"prompt\":\"test\"}' http://192.168.0.99:3333/api/generate"
```

### 3. Current Brand Implementation Assessment
**Simplified Analysis**:
- Review existing BioseroButton, BioseroCard, BioseroIcon usage patterns
- Identify legacy `.btn`, `.card`, `.input-field` classes that need component conversion
- Document current HelixBackground usage in App.vue for removal
- Assess typography (Poppins) and color palette (Biosero colors) implementation
- Note any complex animations or helix elements for simplification

### 4. Performance Baseline Documentation
**Capture Current Metrics**:
```bash
# GPU utilization during AI processing
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "nvidia-smi dmon -s pucvmet -d 1 -c 10"

# Response time testing
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "time curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"prompt\":\"analyze performance\"}' http://192.168.0.99:3333/api/generate"

# System resource utilization
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "htop -n 1 | head -20"

# Container memory usage
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "docker stats --no-stream"
```

### 5. Simplified Brand Requirements Assessment
**Clean Implementation Focus**:
- **Keep Simple**: Poppins typography, Biosero color palette (cyan, purple, blue gradients)
- **Component Standards**: BioseroButton, BioseroCard, BioseroIcon (basic variants only)
- **Remove Complex**: HelixBackground, helix animations, complex glow effects, advanced patterns
- **Tabbed Interface**: Plan for Upload/Database/Chat tab structure in unified interface

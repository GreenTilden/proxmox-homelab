### **Root Cause Analysis: Storage Crisis**
**Primary Technical Blocker Identified**:
```bash
df -h
# Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
# /dev/sda3        20G   20G   28K 100% /
```

**Impact Assessment**:
- **Model Downloads**: All AI model downloads fail with "No space left on device"

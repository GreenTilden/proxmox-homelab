## Specific Tasks

### 1. System Health Verification
**Execute via SSH from development laptop**:
```bash
# GPU acceleration validation (CRITICAL - MUST MAINTAIN 77% processing)
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "nvidia-smi"

# API Gateway health check
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "curl -s http://192.168.0.99:3333/health"

# Frontend accessibility verification
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "curl -s -I http://192.168.0.99:5173"

# Service container status
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "docker ps | grep gbgreg"
```

### 2. Frontend Connection Issue Analysis
**Root Cause Investigation**:
```bash
# JavaScript console error analysis (via SSH log inspection)
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "cd /service-pool/gbgreg-frontend && npm run dev > /tmp/vue-debug.log 2>&1 &"

# CORS configuration verification
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "curl -v -H 'Origin: http://192.168.0.99:5173' http://192.168.0.99:3333/health"

# Network connectivity validation
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "ss -tlnp | grep -E ':(3333|5173)'"

# API endpoint functionality testing
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"prompt\":\"test\"}' http://192.168.0.99:3333/api/generate"
```

### 3. Brand Compliance Gap Assessment
**Current Interface Element Analysis**:
- Identify all UI components requiring Biosero brand transformation
- Document current color palette vs required biosero-* color system
- Assess typography gaps (current vs Poppins font requirement)  
- Catalog generic components that need replacement with Biosero components
- Evaluate animation/interaction patterns against brand standards

### 4. Performance Baseline Documentation
**Capture Current Metrics**:
```bash
# GPU utilization during AI processing
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "nvidia-smi dmon -s pucvmet -d 1 -c 10"

# Response time testing
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "time curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"prompt\":\"analyze performance\"}' http://192.168.0.99:3333/api/generate"

# System resource utilization
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "htop -n 1 | head -20"

# Container memory usage
ssh root@192.168.0.99 "docker stats --no-stream"
```

### 5. Biosero Brand Requirements Research
**Brand Implementation Standards Review**:
- Color System: biosero-gray, biosero-cyan, biosero-green, biosero-purple palette
- Typography: Poppins font with hierarchy (H1: biosero-blue-dark, H2: biosero-cyan)
- Components: BioseroButton, BioseroCard, HelixSpinner, HelixBackground, PageTransition  
- Animations: Helix patterns, gradient effects, brand-compliant transitions
- Layout: Gradient backgrounds, status indicators with brand colors

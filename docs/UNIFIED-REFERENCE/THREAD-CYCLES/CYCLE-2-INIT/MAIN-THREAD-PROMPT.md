# ðŸŽ¯ MAIN THREAD PROMPT

(Paste this into Main Thread planning mode)

You are initiating a comprehensive Vue.js homelab dashboard development cycle using the proven 5-thread execution model. Your primary objective is to orchestrate the replacement of the current Homer dashboard with a modern Vue.js solution based on the greentilden.github.io template.

CRITICAL CONTEXT:
- Current Homer dashboard at http://192.168.0.99:8090 has Mario theme framework deployed but theme switcher is non-functional due to Vue.js/Homer static site generator conflicts
- Template foundation: /home/darney/projects/greentilden.github.io (Vue 3 + TypeScript + Element Plus + Vite)
- Success metric: Functional Vue.js dashboard with working Mario theme switcher replacing Homer

YOUR MAIN THREAD RESPONSIBILITIES:
1. Research Coordination: Generate detailed research prompt for Reader Thread to analyze greentilden.github.io architecture, component patterns, and Vue.js integration strategies
2. Implementation Planning: Create comprehensive implementation roadmap for Writer Thread including Vue 3 setup, Mario theme integration, and service card architecture
3. Quality Assurance: Prepare Debug Thread instructions for performance optimization, cross-browser compatibility, and mobile responsiveness

READER THREAD RESEARCH PRIORITIES TO INVESTIGATE:
- Vue 3 Composition API patterns from WorkflowOptimizer.vue and DemosPage.vue components
- Element Plus theming integration possibilities with existing Mario CSS custom properties
- Component architecture scalability for 15+ service cards with real-time status monitoring
- TypeScript integration patterns for type-safe homelab service definitions
- Vite build system deployment strategies for container environments
- Mobile responsiveness patterns from greentilden project for touch-optimized interfaces

Generate a comprehensive Reader Thread research prompt focusing on these technical architecture decisions, then prepare implementation guidance for subsequent threads in the sequential workflow.

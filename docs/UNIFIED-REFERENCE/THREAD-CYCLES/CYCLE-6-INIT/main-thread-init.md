# CYCLE 6 - MAIN THREAD INITIALIZATION
## üéØ Home Calendar Framework - Carbon Design System Integration

### Cycle Overview
**Cycle ID**: 2025-09-26-CYCLE-6-HOME-CALENDAR-FRAMEWORK
**Objective**: Implement shared admin calendar dashboard with lists functionality and service integration hooks
**Architecture**: Carbon Design System components with Vue.js integration
**Target**: Professional calendar/lists interface with Plex and homelab service integration

---

## üéØ **MAIN THREAD MISSION**

### Primary Objectives
1. **Orchestrate 5-Thread Execution**: Coordinate sequential Reader ‚Üí Writer ‚Üí Debug ‚Üí Documentation workflow
2. **Architecture Coordination**: Ensure Carbon Design System integration aligns with existing dual-theme architecture
3. **Service Integration Strategy**: Define patterns for Plex and homelab service integration hooks
4. **Quality Assurance**: Maintain consistency across all thread implementations

### Main Thread Responsibilities
- **Project Planning**: Overall cycle coordination and timeline management
- **Thread Handoffs**: Structured handoff documentation between sequential threads
- **Integration Oversight**: Ensure component compatibility with existing Vue.js infrastructure
- **Success Validation**: Verify completion criteria across all thread phases

## üèóÔ∏è **ARCHITECTURE FOUNDATION**

### Core Components (Phase 1 - Priority 1)
**Calendar Core**: Carbon DatePicker with calendar popup variant
- Single date selection and date range capabilities
- Localization support for multiple date formats
- Responsive sizing (mobile: 32px, tablet: 40px, desktop: 48px)
- Integration with existing Vue.js dashboard architecture

**Lists Management**: Carbon DataTable with TanStack integration
- CRUD operations for list items (create, read, update, delete)
- Inline editing capabilities for quick updates
- Sorting, filtering, and search functionality
- Pagination for large datasets

### Service Integration Hooks (Phase 2 - Priority 2)
**Plex Integration Patterns**:
- Calendar events with media metadata (movie nights, show premieres)
- Service status badges linked to homelab monitoring
- Quick-action buttons to launch Plex with pre-selected content
- Integration with existing Grafana metrics for service availability

**Architecture Pattern**:
```javascript
// Service integration hooks
const serviceHooks = {
  plex: { badge: 'media', actions: ['play', 'queue'] },
  grafana: { badge: 'monitoring', actions: ['view-metrics'] },
  filebrowser: { badge: 'files', actions: ['browse'] }
}
```

### UI/UX Enhancement (Phase 3 - Priority 3)
**Mobile-First Design**:
- Carbon's fluid layout system for responsive calendar views
- Touch-optimized event manipulation (drag/drop, resize)
- Progressive enhancement from mobile to desktop

**Theme Integration**:
- Extend existing retro/naive theme architecture
- Carbon design tokens integration with current 16-bit aesthetic
- Consistent component styling across dual-theme system

## 🔄 **MANDATORY SEQUENTIAL WORKFLOW**

### **Execution Order** (NEVER deviate):
```
Main → Reader → Writer → Debug (if needed) → Documentation → Main
  ↓       ↓        ↓         ↓                    ↓          ↓

```

### **Thread Handoff Protocol**:
1. **Main Thread**: Generates specific prompt for next thread
2. **Target Thread**: Receives prompt, validates assumptions, executes tasks
3. **Target Thread**: Generates structured report for Main Thread  
4. **Main Thread**: Processes report, determines next thread in sequence
5. **Cycle Continues**: Until project objective achieved

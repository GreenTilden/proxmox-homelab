## üìã **Usage Guidelines**

1. **Always include Cycle ID** in all templates for tracking
2. **Use thread emojis** consistently for visual identification
3. **Be specific** about tasks and outcomes - avoid vague descriptions
4. **Document issues** even if resolved for pattern recognition
5. **Update UNIFIED-REFERENCE** as part of every thread execution
6. **Archive completed cycles** to cycle-history with full context

## üîÑ **Integration Points**

### With 5-Thread Execution Model
- Templates implement the mandatory sequential workflow
- Reports trigger next thread in sequence
- Cycle IDs maintain execution continuity

### With Documentation System  
- All reports contribute to UNIFIED-REFERENCE
- Cycle documentation preserved in THREAD-CYCLES
- Cross-references maintained automatically

### With Agent System
- Thread reports feed agent knowledge bases
- Agents use templates for consistency
- Knowledge transfer follows template structure

---

**These templates ensure consistent, high-quality handoffs between threads and maintain complete execution history.**

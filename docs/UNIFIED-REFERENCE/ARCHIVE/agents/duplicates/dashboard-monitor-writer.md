### Storage Architecture Status
```
Total Capacity: 9.96TB across 3 ZFS pools

Media Processing Patterns (Transferred from Media-Processing-Agent):
- Files Processed: 532 organized into 3 Plex libraries
- Classification System: 
  * Disney Collection: 101 files → /media-pool/plex/Disney/
  * TV Shows: 244 files → /media-pool/plex/TV/
  * Movies: 187 files → /media-pool/plex/Movies/
- Automation: 30-second cron monitoring for new content
- Workflow: staging-pool → classification → media-pool → Plex scan
├── media-pool: 8.7TB (Movies/TV Shows for Plex)
├── service-pool: 232GB (Container configs, fast SSD)  
└── staging-pool: 675GB (Downloads, processing, transcoding)

Recovery Status: ✅ COMPLETE
├── Personal photos: 31 files (43MB) preserved with EXIF
├── Organized content: 929 files (80MB) categorized  
└── Forensic archive: 1,246 files (123MB) for research
```

### Monitoring Metrics Integration
- **System Health**: CPU, memory, storage, network via Node Exporter
- **ZFS Performance**: Pool health, dataset usage, recovery status via custom exporter  
- **Service Availability**: All 8 services monitored with HTTP health checks
- **Mobile Dashboard**: Responsive design confirmed on phone/tablet interfaces

### Container Architecture Lessons Applied
- **✅ Direct ZFS Mounting**: All services use proper pool access patterns
- **✅ LXC for Compatibility**: Deluge bypasses LinuxServer.io s6 permission issues
- **✅ Privilege Management**: Firefox container uses required privileged mode
- **✅ Storage Strategy**: Separation of concerns (media vs processing vs config)

### Current Operational Priorities
1. **GPU Driver Installation**: Enable hardware transcoding for Plex
2. **Repository Cleanup**: Fix Bookworm/Trixie mixing issue
3. **AI Services Deployment**: Ollama + Open WebUI stack
4. **Advanced Monitoring**: Custom alerting and performance thresholds

### Theme Architecture Status
- **CSS Framework**: Modular 16-bit gaming theme with mobile-first design
- **Component Library**: Reusable panels for torrent management, system health
- **Color Palette**: Consistent retro gaming aesthetic across all interfaces
- **Responsive Design**: Confirmed working on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### Agent Knowledge Base
- **Successful Patterns**: LinuxServer Plex, jlesage Firefox, native LXC for problematic services
- **Storage Best Practices**: Direct ZFS mounting, read-only media access, dedicated pools
- **Service Authentication**: NoAuth for trusted networks, proper claim tokens for external services
- **Container Health**: Proper health checks, graceful shutdowns, restart policies

## Recommendations for Next Operations
1. **Maintain Current Stack**: All services stable and operational
2. **Focus on Enhancement**: GPU drivers, AI services, advanced automation
3. **Documentation**: Continue archiving successful patterns for future deployments
4. **Monitoring**: Expand alerting capabilities for proactive maintenance

**Overall Assessment**: Homelab infrastructure is production-ready with comprehensive monitoring, successful media acquisition pipeline, and robust storage architecture.

# GBGreg Integration History - Archive

**Archive Date**: 2025-09-05  
**Status**: ðŸ”’ **ARCHIVED - GBGreg Project Separated**

## Archive Purpose

This directory contains the complete integration history of GBGreg (AI Laboratory Automation Platform) within the proxmox-homelab project. As of 2025-09-05, GBGreg has been successfully separated into its own independent project with full 5-thread workflow capabilities.

## Integration Success Summary

### âœ… **Achievements Completed**
- **Multi-Model AI Architecture**: 4 specialized AI containers with intelligent routing
- **Enterprise API Gateway**: Express.js with PostgreSQL integration
- **Modern Vue.js Frontend**: Terminal-inspired design with mobile responsiveness
- **Production Monitoring**: Grafana integration with custom AI metrics
- **GPU Acceleration**: RTX 5070 Ti with 83% efficient VRAM utilization
- **Safety Framework**: C# 4.0 constraint validation with laboratory equipment guardrails

### ðŸŽ¯ **Final Infrastructure Status**
- **AI Services**: 4x Ollama containers operational (ports 11436-11439)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on port 5433
- **API Gateway**: Express.js on port 3333
- **Frontend**: Vue.js on port 5173
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics exported to homelab Grafana

### ðŸš€ **Separation Outcome**
- **Homelab Project**: Clean infrastructure focus with GBGreg as external AI service
- **GBGreg Project**: Independent development with complete 5-thread workflow
- **Integration Points**: GPU sharing, monitoring data flow, service dependencies maintained

## Current Status Post-Separation

### **Homelab Project Perspective**
GBGreg is now referenced as an **external AI service** that:
- Utilizes homelab GPU resources (RTX 5070 Ti)
- Integrates monitoring data into homelab Grafana dashboards  
- Operates independently with its own development workflow
- Provides laboratory automation capabilities via defined API interfaces

### **GBGreg Project Status**
GBGreg continues as an independent project with:
- **Location**: `/home/darney/projects/GBGreg/`
- **Documentation**: Complete migration to `GBGreg/docs/`
- **Workflow**: Full 5-thread Claude Code development model
- **Infrastructure**: All AI services operational and production-ready

## Integration Lessons Learned

### **Technical Achievements**
- **GPU Sharing Protocol**: Successful multi-project GPU resource allocation
- **Monitoring Integration**: Seamless metrics flow from external project to homelab dashboards
- **Service Orchestration**: Independent container management with cross-project monitoring
- **Documentation Architecture**: Successful knowledge base migration and reorganization

### **Development Workflow Insights**
- **5-Thread Adaptation**: Proven workflow model successfully adapted for AI development
- **Worktree Strategy**: Independent project worktrees enable parallel specialized development
- **Infrastructure Separation**: Clean separation without loss of integration capabilities
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Complete documentation migration with preserved development history

## üîß Phase 2: Development & Management (Priority 2)
**Multi-Threaded Coordination**: Reader researches, Writer implements, Features specialize

### 2.1 Container Orchestration ‚Üí **Feature Branch: container-mgmt**
**Timeline**: 2-3 days
**Thread Assignment**: Feature Branch (specialized container management focus)
```bash
# Deploy Portainer with proper storage mounting
docker run -d --name portainer \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v /service-pool/portainer:/data \
  -v /media-pool:/srv/media-pool:ro \
  -v /staging-pool:/srv/staging-pool \
  portainer/portainer-ce

# Set up Docker Compose stacks with ZFS pool architecture
# Configure container networking
# Implement backup strategies
```

**Storage Architecture Requirements**:
- All container deployments MUST follow proper ZFS pool mounting patterns
- Management tools require read access to all pools for visibility
- Document storage patterns for each service type
**Status Reporting**: Feature ‚Üí Main with container management capabilities and storage integration validation

### 2.2 Development Environment
**Timeline**: 2-3 days
```bash
# Deploy code-server (web-based VSCode)
# Configure AI coding assistants
# Set up development workflows
# Git integration and project management
```

## üìã Implementation Strategy

### Prerequisites: Multi-Threaded Orchestrated Architecture
**CRITICAL**: All development MUST use orchestrated multi-threaded approach
- **Main Branch**: Coordinates all phases and consolidates status reports
- **Reader Thread**: Validates system status before/during/after implementations  
- **Writer Thread**: Handles infrastructure implementations (GPU, Plex, system configs)
- **Feature Branches**: Specialize in complex deployments (AI, container management, etc.)
- Review `/home/darney/projects/proxmox-homelab/docs/orchestrated-worktree-strategy.md`
- Review `/home/darney/projects/proxmox-homelab/docs/container-storage-architecture.md`
- Update all Docker configurations to mount actual pools (`/media-pool`, `/service-pool`, `/staging-pool`)

### Week 1: Core Services (Multi-Threaded)
- Day 0: **Orchestrated Status Check** - Reader thread validates all systems before Writer implementations
- Day 1-2: **GPU drivers** (Writer thread) + **Interface validation** (Reader thread) 
- Day 3-4: **Plex deployment** (Writer thread) + **Service monitoring** (Reader thread)
- Day 5-7: **AI/LLM infrastructure** (ai-services feature branch) + **Status consolidation** (Main thread)

### Week 2: Development Platform
- Day 1-3: Container orchestration and management
- Day 4-5: Development environment setup
- Day 6-7: Enhanced monitoring and alerting

### Week 3: Network & Automation
- Day 1-3: Network services (DNS, proxy, VPN)
- Day 4-7: Home Assistant and IoT integration

### Week 4: Advanced Features

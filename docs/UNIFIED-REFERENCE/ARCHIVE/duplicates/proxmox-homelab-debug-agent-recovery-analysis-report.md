# Plex Drive Recovery Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
Complete analysis of 3.6TB Plex media drive recovery after ZFS pool corruption. Successfully recovered and categorized 960 image files totaling 88MB from the original corrupted filesystem.

## Recovery Results

### Files Successfully Recovered
- **Total Images**: 960 JPEG files processed and organized
- **Personal Photos**: 31 high-resolution photos (>500KB) with EXIF data
- **Plex Thumbnails**: 929 smaller images (<500KB) likely from media metadata
- **Original Files Preserved**: All 1,246 carved files maintained in `/media-pool/carved-originals/`

### Notable Personal Photo Recovery
- **Samsung Galaxy Phone Photos**: Multiple photos from SPH-L900 device (2014-2015 era)
- **High Resolution**: Several 2448x3264 pixel images with complete EXIF data
- **Adobe Processed**: Some images show "Adobe Photoshop 4.0" editing history
- **Date Range**: Photos spanning multiple years, primarily 2014-2015

### Metadata Extraction Insights

#### Device Information Recovered:
- **Samsung SPH-L900** (Galaxy S III) - Primary photo source
- **Adobe Photoshop 4.0** - Image editing software used
- **Windows Photo Viewer 6.3.9600** - Image viewing/management software

#### File Size Distribution:
- **<10KB**: 176 files (thumbnails, corrupted fragments)
- **10-100KB**: 753 files (Plex metadata, small thumbnails)
- **100-500KB**: 15 files (larger Plex artwork, medium photos)
- **500KB-1MB**: 15 files (personal photos)
- **>1MB**: 16 files (high-quality personal photos)

## Original Media Collection Analysis

### Inferred Content from Plex Metadata
Based on recovered thumbnail patterns and file characteristics:

1. **Movie Collection**: Significant number of poster-sized images (typical Plex movie artwork dimensions)
2. **TV Shows**: Multiple small thumbnails suggesting episode collections
3. **Mixed Media**: Various aspect ratios indicating diverse content types
4. **Well-Organized Library**: Consistent thumbnail sizes suggest proper Plex metadata management

### Lost Content Assessment
- **Video Files**: 0% recovery rate - all MP4/MKV/AVI files lost
- **Audio Files**: 0% recovery rate - no music files recovered
- **Estimated Original Content**: Based on 3.6TB capacity, likely contained:
  - 500-1000 movies (HD quality)
  - Multiple TV series (potentially 50-100 complete seasons)
  - Music collection (estimated 10,000+ tracks)

## Technical Recovery Details

### ZFS Filesystem Analysis
- **Pool Metadata**: Completely corrupted, no viable reconstruction possible
- **Uberblocks**: No valid ZFS uberblocks found in image
- **vdev Headers**: ZFS structural data irretrievably damaged
- **Data Blocks**: Only JPEG headers survived fragmentation

### Recovery Tool Performance
- **Foremost**: Successfully recovered 1,246 JPEG files, failed on video files
- **PhotoRec**: Found no additional files beyond Foremost results
- **File Carving Limitations**: Large video files too fragmented for reconstruction

## Storage Architecture Implemented

### Multi-Tier Preservation
1. **Original Carved Files** (`/media-pool/carved-originals/`) - 122MB ZFS dataset
2. **Personal Photos** (`/media-pool/media/personal-photos/`) - 42MB curated collection
3. **Plex Thumbnails** (`/media-pool/media/final-recovery/Thumbnails/`) - 46MB organized metadata

### Data Integrity Protection
- ZFS snapshots created for all recovered data
- Checksumming enabled for corruption detection
- Multiple access paths for different use cases

## Lessons Learned & Recommendations

### Critical Backup Failures Identified
1. **No ZFS Snapshots**: Pool corruption could have been rolled back
2. **No Off-site Backup**: All data was single-point-of-failure
3. **No File-Level Backup**: Individual files not preserved outside ZFS

### Recommended Future Strategy
1. **Automated ZFS Snapshots**: Hourly/daily/weekly snapshot retention
2. **Off-site Replication**: ZFS send/receive to remote location
3. **File-Level Backup**: Regular rsync/rclone to cloud storage
4. **Testing**: Regular restore testing and recovery drills

## Recovery Value Assessment

### Successful Recoveries
- **Personal Photos**: High sentimental value - 31 family/personal photos recovered
- **Media History**: Insight into viewing preferences and collection organization
- **Technical Learning**: Comprehensive data recovery experience gained

### Permanent Losses
- **Main Media Collection**: 3.6TB of movies, TV shows, and music permanently lost
- **Plex Metadata**: Custom ratings, watch history, and organizational data
- **Time Investment**: Years of media curation and organization

## Conclusion
While the main media collection is permanently lost, the recovery operation successfully salvaged valuable personal photos and provided insights into proper backup strategies. The preserved data structure allows for future analysis and serves as a foundation for building improved data protection systems.

**Final Status**: Recovery operation complete with maximum possible data preservation achieved under the circumstances.

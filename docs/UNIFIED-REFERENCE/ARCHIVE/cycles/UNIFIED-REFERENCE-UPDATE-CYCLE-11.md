## Core System Status Updates

### GBGreg Enterprise System - OPERATIONAL (with performance limitations)
**Location**: `192.168.0.99` - All containers running
**Status**: 🟡 **Functional but performance-limited due to GPU acceleration failure**

#### Service Endpoints (All Active):
- **API Gateway**: http://192.168.0.99:3333 - Enhanced with file upload capabilities
- **Coordinator Model**: http://192.168.0.99:11436 - llama3.2:3b (674ms response)
- **Technical Model**: http://192.168.0.99:11437 - deepseek-coder:6.7b (28.6s response) ❌
- **Documentation Model**: http://192.168.0.99:11438 - llama3.1:8b + llama3.2:1b (4-6s response)
- **Vision Model**: http://192.168.0.99:11439 - llava:7b (30s+ response) ❌
- **Database**: http://192.168.0.99:5433 - PostgreSQL 15 with enhanced schema

#### New Capabilities Deployed:
✅ **File Upload System**: Multi-format file processing with 100MB limit  
✅ **Project Management**: Multi-file project upload and organization  
✅ **Screenshot Analysis**: Vision model integration for image processing  
✅ **Database Analytics**: Usage tracking and performance monitoring  
✅ **Intelligent Routing**: Automatic model selection based on prompt complexity

#### Critical Performance Issue:
❌ **GPU Acceleration Failure**: All models using CPU inference (0% GPU utilization)  
❌ **Response Time Failure**: Technical and Vision models 6-10x slower than targets  
❌ **User Testing Blocked**: Unacceptable response times prevent enterprise use

### Hardware Configuration - RTX 5070 Ti Ready but Unutilized
**GPU Status**: Hardware installed, drivers operational, Docker GPU runtime configured
**Issue**: Ollama containers lack CUDA libraries, preventing GPU utilization
**Impact**: System performing at 10-15% of potential capacity

## Current Thread Execution Status

### 5-Thread Execution Model Status:
- **🎯 Main (Opus)**: Awaiting Writer Thread report for coordination
- **🔍 Reader (Sonnet)**: Live monitoring established in previous cycle
- **⚡ Writer (Opus)**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Infrastructure deployed with GPU issue documented
- **🔧 Debug (Opus)**: **REQUIRED** - GPU acceleration resolution needed
- **📚 Documentation (Sonnet)**: **PENDING** - Knowledge synthesis from implementation

### Sequential Workflow Position: 
**⚡ Writer → 🎯 Main** (Implementation handoff for coordination)

### Next Thread Handoff: 
**🎯 Main Thread** for implementation report processing and Debug Thread escalation

## Operational Capabilities Assessment

### ✅ Ready for Production Use:
- **File Management**: Complete upload, project organization, ZIP extraction
- **Database Operations**: Analytics, tracking, performance monitoring  
- **API Integration**: RESTful endpoints with proper error handling
- **System Monitoring**: Health checks and status reporting
- **Multi-Model Coordination**: Intelligent routing between 4 AI models

### ⚠️ Limited Capabilities (Performance Degraded):
- **Simple AI Tasks**: Coordinator model acceptable performance (0.6s)
- **Basic Documentation**: Documentation model functional (4-6s)
- **File Analysis**: Technical code analysis working but slow (28s)
- **Image Processing**: Screenshot analysis operational but impractical (30s+)

### ❌ Blocked Capabilities:
- **Real-time AI Interaction**: Response times unacceptable for users
- **Enterprise User Testing**: Performance prevents daily testing scenarios
- **Concurrent Multi-user Sessions**: CPU bottleneck prevents scaling
- **Production Deployment**: Performance standards not met

## Critical Issues Requiring Resolution

### Priority 1: GPU Acceleration Failure
**Technical Details**:
- **Root Cause**: ollama/ollama:latest images lack CUDA runtime libraries
- **Evidence**: nvidia-smi shows 0% GPU utilization during inference
- **Impact**: 6-10x performance degradation vs. requirements
- **Required Action**: Deploy CUDA-enabled containers or manual CUDA installation

### Priority 2: Performance Target Failures  
**Current vs. Target Performance**:
- Technical Model: 28.6s vs <5s target (573% over limit)
- Vision Model: 30+s vs <5s target (600% over limit)
- Complex Workflows: 60+s vs <30s target (200% over limit)

### Priority 3: User Testing Readiness
**Blocking Issues**:
- Daily user scenarios require <5s response times
- Multi-user concurrent testing impossible with current performance
- Enterprise readiness assessment cannot proceed

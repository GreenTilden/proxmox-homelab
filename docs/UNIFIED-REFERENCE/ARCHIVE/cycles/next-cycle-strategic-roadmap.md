        self.gbg_classifier = GBGInterfaceClassifier()
        self.pattern_matcher = BioseraPatternMatcher()
        self.confidence_threshold = 0.80  # Production quality threshold
        
    def analyze_realtime(self, screenshot_data):
        """Production-ready screenshot analysis pipeline"""
        
        # Performance target: <3 seconds end-to-end
        start_time = time.time()

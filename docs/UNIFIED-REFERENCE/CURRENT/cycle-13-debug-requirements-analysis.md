## 🎯 **IDENTIFIED ISSUES FOR DEBUG THREAD**

### **Priority 1: Backend Model Integration Issues** 🚨 **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Issue**: Documentation and Vision models showing "fetch failed" status while primary models operational

**Evidence from System Health Check**:
```json
{
  "models": {
    "coordinator": {"status": "healthy", "loadedModels": 1},
    "technical": {"status": "healthy", "loadedModels": 1}, 
    "documentation": {"status": "error", "error": "fetch failed"},
    "vision": {"status": "error", "error": "fetch failed"}
  }
}
```

**Debug Tasks Required**:
- **Container Health Analysis**: Diagnose why documentation and vision model containers failing
- **Network Connectivity**: Verify internal container communication on expected ports
- **Model Loading**: Investigate if models are properly pulled and available in containers
- **Resource Allocation**: Check if containers have adequate memory/GPU access
- **Configuration Validation**: Verify model routing configuration in API Gateway

**Success Criteria**: All 4 model services showing "healthy" status with loaded models

---

### **Priority 2: Frontend Development Environment Optimization** 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Issue**: Multiple Vue development servers and incomplete Tailwind configuration

**Evidence from Implementation Audit**:
- **Port Confusion**: Frontend running on ports 5173, 5174, 5175 simultaneously
- **Tailwind Config**: Still has default colors, missing Biosero palette integration
- **Build Process**: Unclear which development server instance is authoritative
- **Component Registration**: Potential issues with Biosero components not properly compiled

**Debug Tasks Required**:
- **Development Server Cleanup**: Identify and stop redundant Vue dev servers
- **Tailwind Configuration**: Complete Biosero color palette integration in tailwind.config.js
- **Build Process Optimization**: Ensure single authoritative development environment
- **Component Testing**: Validate all Biosero components render correctly with proper styling

**Success Criteria**: Single dev server operational with complete Biosero styling integration

---

### **Priority 3: End-to-End User Workflow Validation** 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Issue**: Comprehensive user workflow testing not completed

**Workflow Validation Required**:
- **Upload Functionality**: Test file upload through tabbed interface to backend processing
- **Database Integration**: Verify script storage, retrieval, and search functionality
- **Chat Interface**: Validate AI interaction through complete request/response cycle
- **Tab Navigation**: Ensure seamless switching between Upload/Database/Chat interfaces
- **Data Persistence**: Confirm uploaded files and generated content properly stored

**Debug Tasks Required**:
- **User Journey Testing**: Complete Upload → Process → Store → Retrieve workflow
- **Error Handling**: Test and validate error conditions and user feedback
- **Performance Validation**: Ensure all workflows meet <10 second response targets
- **Data Integrity**: Verify proper file handling and database operations

**Success Criteria**: All user workflows operational with proper error handling and performance

---

### **Priority 4: System Monitoring & Health Validation** 🟢 **LOW PRIORITY**
**Issue**: Comprehensive system health monitoring not established

**Monitoring Gaps Identified**:
- **GPU Performance Tracking**: Long-term GPU utilization and thermal monitoring
- **Model Performance Metrics**: Response time trending and quality assessment
- **Container Health Monitoring**: Automated health checks for all 4 model containers
- **Resource Usage Tracking**: Memory, disk, and network utilization monitoring

**Debug Tasks Required**:
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Integrate system metrics into existing Grafana infrastructure
- **Alert Configuration**: Establish thresholds for performance degradation alerts
- **Health Check Automation**: Implement automated container health validation
- **Performance Baselines**: Document normal operating parameters for comparison

**Success Criteria**: Complete system monitoring integrated with existing Grafana dashboard

## 🔧 **DEBUG THREAD APPROACH STRATEGY**

### **Sequential Task Execution**
1. **Backend Model Recovery**: Address failing documentation and vision models FIRST
2. **Frontend Environment Polish**: Clean up development environment and complete styling
3. **User Workflow Validation**: Test and validate complete user experience
4. **Monitoring Integration**: Establish comprehensive system health monitoring

### **Validation Requirements**
- **Each Priority Level**: Must be completed and validated before proceeding to next
- **Performance Baseline**: Maintain 77% GPU utilization and <10s response times
- **No Regression**: Ensure Debug Thread work doesn't impact Writer Thread successes
- **Documentation**: All fixes must be documented in UNIFIED-REFERENCE

### **Success Thresholds**
- **P1 Success**: All 4 backend models operational with "healthy" status
- **P2 Success**: Single dev server with complete Biosero styling integration  
- **P3 Success**: All user workflows tested and operational
- **P4 Success**: Comprehensive monitoring dashboard operational

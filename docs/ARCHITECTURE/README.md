# Architecture Standards Documentation

This directory contains proven architectural patterns, standards, and design decisions for the Proxmox homelab infrastructure.

## Directory Purpose

**Architecture documentation** represents battle-tested patterns, standards, and design principles that have been validated through real-world implementation. These documents serve as:

- **Reference Standards** for consistent system design
- **Proven Patterns** from successful implementations
- **Design Principles** for new service deployments
- **Best Practices** learned through operational experience

## Documentation Contents

### Storage & Infrastructure
- **[storage-mounting.md](storage-mounting.md)** - Container storage architecture with ZFS pools
  - Direct ZFS pool mounting patterns
  - Service-specific storage strategies  
  - Performance optimization by workload type
  - Proven Docker and LXC mount configurations

### Development & Coordination
- **[worktree-strategy.md](worktree-strategy.md)** - Orchestrated multi-threaded development
  - Git worktree coordination protocols
  - Thread specialization and task distribution
  - Status reporting templates and communication patterns
  - Proven parallel development workflows

### Hardware Allocation
- **[gpu-allocation.md](gpu-allocation.md)** - Dual GPU strategic allocation
  - RTX 5070 Ti vs GTX 970 workload assignment
  - GPU passthrough configuration patterns
  - Dynamic allocation and load balancing
  - Service-specific GPU requirements

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Proven Implementation Requirement
All architectural standards documented here have been:
- âœ… Implemented in the actual homelab environment
- âœ… Tested under real-world workloads
- âœ… Validated through operational experience
- âœ… Refined based on lessons learned

### 2. Pattern-Based Design
- **Repeatable**: Patterns can be applied to new services consistently  
- **Scalable**: Standards support growth and expansion
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns and responsibilities
- **Documented**: Complete implementation details and rationale

### 3. Technology Agnostic Principles
- **Container Standards**: Apply to Docker, LXC, and future technologies
- **Storage Patterns**: Independent of underlying hardware changes
- **Development Workflows**: Scalable to team environments
- **Resource Allocation**: Adaptable to different hardware configurations

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Production-Ready Standards
- **Storage Mounting**: Validated across 6+ services with proper ZFS integration
- **Worktree Strategy**: Proven effective for complex multi-faceted development
- **GPU Allocation**: Design validated, implementation pending driver availability

### ðŸ”§ Active Evolution
Standards in this directory are living documents that evolve based on:
- New service deployment experiences
- Performance optimization discoveries  
- Technology updates and improvements
- Scaling requirements and lessons learned

## Usage Guidelines

### For New Service Deployments
1. **Review Relevant Standards**: Check existing patterns before designing new solutions
2. **Follow Proven Patterns**: Use established standards unless compelling reason to deviate
3. **Document Deviations**: Explain and document any variations from standards
4. **Update Standards**: Contribute improvements back to architectural documentation

### For System Modifications
1. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate how changes affect existing architectural patterns
2. **Standard Updates**: Update documentation to reflect architectural evolution
3. **Migration Guidance**: Provide guidance for existing services to adopt new patterns
4. **Validation**: Test architectural changes in non-production environments first

# Orchestrated Worktree Strategy Guide

## Overview
This document establishes the comprehensive strategy for coordinated multi-threaded development using Git worktrees, enabling parallel Claude sessions to work efficiently on different aspects of the homelab project.

## Architecture Philosophy

### Central Coordination Model
The **main branch** serves as the orchestration hub, with specialized branches handling specific types of work:

```
Main Branch (Orchestrator)
├── Reader Branch (Research & Status)
├── Writer Branch (Implementation)  
└── Feature Branches (Isolated Development)
    ├── plex-setup/
    ├── gpu-config/
    └── monitoring-enhancement/
```

## Thread Specialization

### Main Branch - Project Orchestrator
**Role**: Strategic coordination and documentation
**Responsibilities**:
- Project planning and roadmap management
- Consolidating status reports from all threads
- Task assignment and priority management
- Cross-cutting documentation updates
- Release coordination and integration

**Typical Activities**:
- Update CLAUDE.md with consolidated project status
- Create and manage project roadmaps
- Coordinate between reader/writer threads
- Handle merge conflicts and integration issues
- Document lessons learned and best practices

### Reader Branch - Research & Analysis
**Role**: System investigation and status reporting
**Model**: Sonnet (efficient for research tasks)
**Responsibilities**:
- System health monitoring and reporting
- Web interface exploration and documentation
- Log analysis and troubleshooting research
- Configuration file analysis
- Performance metrics gathering

**Typical Activities**:
```bash
# System health checks
/usr/local/bin/system-monitor.sh
zpool status && zfs list
docker ps -a && docker stats --no-stream

# Interface exploration  
curl -k https://192.168.0.99:8006  # Proxmox
curl http://192.168.0.99:3000      # Grafana
curl http://192.168.0.99:8080      # FileBrowser

# Research and documentation
grep -r "error" /var/log/
cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep -E "(model|flags)"
lspci | grep -E "(VGA|NVIDIA)"
```

### Writer Branch - Implementation
**Role**: System modifications and deployments
**Model**: Opus (powerful for complex implementation)
**Responsibilities**:
- Container deployments and configuration
- System configuration changes
- Service installations and updates
- Hardware configuration (GPU drivers, etc.)
- Database and storage modifications

**Typical Activities**:
```bash
# Container deployments
docker run -d --name service [proper ZFS mounts]
docker-compose up -d

# System modifications
apt install/update packages
systemctl enable/start services
nvidia-driver installation

# Configuration changes
edit /etc/config-files
restart services
verify functionality
```

### Feature Branches - Specialized Development
**Role**: Isolated feature development
**Model**: Context-dependent (Sonnet for research phases, Opus for implementation)
**Responsibilities**:
- Self-contained feature development
- Feature-specific testing and validation
- Integration preparation
- Feature documentation

## Communication Protocols

```

### Inter-Thread Communication

#### Request Patterns
```bash
# Reader requesting information for writer
## Reader → Main: "GPU driver status needed for Plex deployment"
## Main → Writer: "Priority task: verify nvidia-smi functionality"

# Writer requesting research from reader  
## Writer → Main: "Need Proxmox container limits before deployment"
## Main → Reader: "Research: Proxmox resource allocation best practices"

# Feature branch coordination
## Feature → Main: "plex-setup ready for integration testing"
## Main → Reader: "Validate Plex service accessibility"
## Main → Writer: "Deploy Plex integration to production"
```

## Task Distribution Strategy

### Decision Matrix

| Task Category | Primary Thread | Secondary | Rationale |
|---------------|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| **System Monitoring** | Reader | - | Read-only, frequent updates needed |
| **Research & Documentation** | Reader | Main | Information gathering focus |
| **Interface Exploration** | Reader | - | Discovery and analysis work |
| **Container Deployment** | Writer | - | System modification required |
| **Configuration Changes** | Writer | - | Persistent system changes |
| **Service Installation** | Writer | - | Package management and setup |
| **Integration Testing** | Feature | Writer | Isolated testing environment |
| **Performance Optimization** | Feature | Reader | Specialized analysis needed |
| **Security Hardening** | Feature | Writer | Specialized security focus |
| **Documentation Updates** | Main | Any | Cross-cutting coordination |

### Workload Balancing

#### High-Intensity Periods
- **Reader**: During troubleshooting, system analysis phases
- **Writer**: During deployment sprints, major installations  
- **Features**: During feature development cycles
- **Main**: During integration phases, planning periods

#### Load Distribution
```bash
# Example parallel workload:
# Reader: Monitoring Proxmox + Grafana interface health
# Writer: Deploying Plex with GPU transcoding
# Feature/gpu-config: Optimizing NVIDIA driver configuration
# Main: Updating documentation with progress from all threads
```

## Synchronization Procedures

### Regular Sync Schedule
- **Hourly**: Status updates from active threads to main
- **Daily**: Full branch synchronization and conflict resolution
- **Weekly**: Cross-branch integration and testing
- **Monthly**: Strategy review and process optimization

### Conflict Resolution Protocol
1. **Detection**: Automated conflict detection during sync
2. **Analysis**: Main branch analyzes conflict scope and impact
3. **Resolution**: Coordinate resolution strategy between affected threads
4. **Verification**: All affected threads verify resolution
5. **Documentation**: Update procedures to prevent similar conflicts

### Emergency Coordination
```bash
# Critical issue escalation:
## Any Thread → Main: "URGENT: [issue description]" 
## Main → All Threads: "STOP: Coordinate resolution for [issue]"
## Resolution → All Threads: "RESUME: [issue resolved, continue work]"
```

## Efficiency Measurement

### Key Performance Indicators

#### Throughput Metrics
- **Tasks completed per thread per day**
- **Average task completion time by complexity**
- **Parallel work efficiency** (simultaneous thread productivity)
- **Context switching overhead** (time lost in coordination)

#### Quality Metrics  
- **Integration success rate** (merges without conflicts)
- **Rework frequency** (tasks requiring revision)
- **Documentation completeness** (coverage of implemented features)
- **Error rates** (issues introduced per implementation)

#### Coordination Effectiveness
- **Status report timeliness** (reports delivered on schedule)
- **Communication clarity** (actionable information exchange)
- **Task assignment accuracy** (right task to right thread)
- **Conflict resolution time** (speed of issue resolution)

### Measurement Tools

#### Automated Metrics Collection
```bash
# Git statistics
git log --oneline --since="1 week ago" --author="Thread-Name"
git log --merges --since="1 month ago"

# Work distribution analysis
git shortlog -sne --since="1 month ago"
git log --stat --since="1 week ago"

# Productivity tracking
lines_added=$(git log --numstat --since="1 week ago" | awk '{add+=$1} END {print add}')
commits_count=$(git log --oneline --since="1 week ago" | wc -l)
```

#### Manual Assessment
- Weekly retrospectives on coordination effectiveness
- Monthly analysis of task distribution balance  
- Quarterly strategy refinement based on lessons learned
- Semi-annual comprehensive workflow optimization

## Best Practices & Lessons Learned

### Successful Patterns
1. **Clear Task Boundaries**: Well-defined scope prevents thread overlap
2. **Regular Communication**: Frequent status updates prevent blocking
3. **Documentation First**: Document before implementing for coordination
4. **Incremental Progress**: Small, frequent updates over large changes
5. **Conflict Prevention**: Proactive coordination over reactive resolution

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Communication Gaps**: Missing status updates cause coordination failures
2. **Scope Creep**: Threads taking on inappropriate tasks
3. **Sync Delays**: Infrequent synchronization causes merge conflicts
4. **Context Loss**: Inadequate documentation of decisions and rationale
5. **Over-Coordination**: Excessive meetings/communication reducing productivity

### Optimization Opportunities
- **Automated Status Collection**: Reduce manual reporting overhead
- **Intelligent Task Routing**: ML-based task assignment optimization  
- **Predictive Conflict Detection**: Early warning systems for merge issues
- **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Real-time workload redistribution
- **Continuous Process Improvement**: Data-driven workflow refinement

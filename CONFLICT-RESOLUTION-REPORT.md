- **Actual Status**: Plex container exists but process runs natively (port 32400)
- **Resolution**: Clarified implementation details while maintaining service functionality

## Conflict Resolution Methodology

### Verification Priority Hierarchy
1. **SSH Command Results**: Direct system access to 192.168.0.99 (highest authority)
2. **HTTP Status Codes**: Service accessibility testing with curl commands
3. **Container Status**: Docker and LXC container status verification
4. **Process Verification**: Native service process confirmation

### Evidence Standards Applied
- **Service Status**: Must respond with HTTP 200/302 to be marked operational
- **Container Status**: Must show "running" or "up" status to be marked active
- **Network Access**: Must be accessible from external host to claim external access
- **Capacity Numbers**: Must match `df -h` and `zfs list` command outputs

### Documentation Standards Established
- **CURRENT/ Directory Rule**: Only SSH-verifiable facts allowed
- **Status Claims**: All service claims must be backed by HTTP status codes
- **Verification Protocol**: Regular SSH validation required for accuracy maintenance
